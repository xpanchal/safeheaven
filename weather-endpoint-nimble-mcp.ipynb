    "# \uD83C\uDF26️ Introduction | Using Nimble for Live Weather Tracking Information\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate **Nimble's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** with **Databricks** to enable **live weather tracking and alerting** workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the growing impact of extreme weather conditions, real-time awareness is critical for applications in:\n",
    "- Emergency response\n",
    "- Transportation and logistics\n",
    "- Supply chain risk management\n",
    "- Insurance and underwriting\n",
    "- Public safety alert systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## \uD83D\uDD27 What is the MCP Server?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MCP server** allows Databricks agents to query external data sources in real-time with context awareness. When connected to a remote weather endpoint (such as NOAA, OpenWeatherMap, or trusted regional sources), agents can extract and interpret live data like:\n",
    "- Severe weather warnings (floods, tornadoes, storms)\n",
    "- Regional temperature anomalies\n",
    "- Wind and precipitation alerts\n",
    "- Real-time satellite-based observations\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Key Use Cases for Weather Alerting with MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Localized Alerting Dashboards**\n",
    "   - Use MCP queries to populate interactive dashboards for different regions.\n",
    "   - Example: “Show all active severe weather alerts for California.”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Proactive Notifications via Agent**\n",
    "   - Create a Databricks agent that polls MCP-connected weather feeds and sends Slack or SMS alerts to users in affected ZIP codes.\n",
    "   - Example: “If wind speed > 60 mph near any company facility, trigger alert.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ML-Driven Risk Estimation**\n",
    "   - Use MCP weather context in model training or scoring for insurance, logistics, or agriculture.\n",
    "   - Example: “Fetch past 30 days of rainfall data before estimating crop yield risks.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## \uD83D\uDD10 Ensuring Trusted Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain accuracy and integrity of weather alerts, always **limit MCP requests to reputable data providers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Source | Use Case | Endpoint |\n",
    "|--------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| NOAA (National Weather Service) | U.S. weather warnings & alerts | `https://api.weather.gov/alerts` |\n",
    "| OpenWeatherMap | Global real-time weather data | `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather` |\n",
    "| Meteomatics | High-resolution global weather | `https://api.meteomatics.com/` |\n",
    "| Environment Canada | Canadian severe weather alerts | `https://dd.weather.gc.ca/alerts/` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Add validation filters in your agent code to:\n",
    "- Restrict domain lookups (e.g., `.gov`, `.org`)\n",
    "- Enforce schema compliance and trusted SSL certificates\n",
    "- Confirm update timestamps to detect stale data\n",
